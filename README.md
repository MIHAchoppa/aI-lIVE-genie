## API Documentation

### Memory Manager

#### ConversationalMemory

```python
memory = ConversationalMemory(max_history=50)

# Add messages
memory.add_message("user", "Hello!")
memory.add_message("assistant", "Hi there!")

# Get conversation history
history = memory.get_history(last_n=10)

# Get context summary
summary = memory.get_context_summary()

# Clear history
memory.clear()
```

#### LongTermMemory

```python
long_term = LongTermMemory(storage_path="long_term_memory.json")

# Store data
long_term.store_fact("Important information", category="general")
long_term.store_preference("theme", "dark")
long_term.store_entity("my_channel", {"platform": "YouTube", "subs": 1000})

# Retrieve data
facts = long_term.retrieve_facts(category="general")
theme = long_term.retrieve_preference("theme")
channel = long_term.retrieve_entity("my_channel")

# Search memory
results = long_term.search_memory("channel")
```

#### GoalsManager

```python
goals = GoalsManager(storage_path="goals.json")

# Create a goal
goal = goals.add_goal(
    title="Reach 1000 subs",
    description="First milestone",
    priority="high",
    target_date="2025-12-31"
)

# Update progress
goals.update_goal_progress(goal_id=1, progress=45)

# Add milestones
goals.add_milestone(goal_id=1, milestone="Reach 500 subs")

# Complete a goal
goals.complete_goal(goal_id=1)

# Get goals
active_goals = goals.get_active_goals()
specific_goal = goals.get_goal_by_id(1)
```

### Streaming Platform Data

#### StreamingPlatformData

```python
streaming = StreamingPlatformData()

# Get platform information
youtube_data = streaming.get_platform_data("youtube")
all_platforms = streaming.get_all_platforms()

# Calculate earnings
earnings = streaming.calculate_earnings("youtube", 50000)
# Returns: {
#     "platform": "youtube",
#     "views": 50000,
#     "estimated_earnings": {
#         "min": 12.50,
#         "max": 200.00,
#         "average": 75.00,
#         "currency": "USD"
#     }
# }

# Compare platforms
comparison = streaming.compare_platforms(100000)
# Returns list of platforms ranked by earnings

# Get conversion rates
conversion = streaming.get_conversion_rates("view_to_subscriber")

# Calculate expected subscribers
subs = streaming.calculate_subscribers_from_views("youtube", 10000, "average")
